## 📄 Description
A reproducible template for image classification using ClearML, PyTorch Lightning, and TIMM. This template is designed to streamline the process of setting up and running image classification experiments with built-in support for data integration, model training, and artifact management. It aims to provide a robust and flexible framework for both beginners and advanced users.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **PyTorch Lightning**: For flexible and scalable model training.
- **ClearML**: For experiment management and tracking.
- **TIMM**: For access to a wide range of pre-trained models.

## ✨ Features
- [ ] **Input Data**: Integration with CVAT for data annotation.
- [ ] **Input Data**: Integration with Minio/S3 storage for data management.
- [ ] **Input Model**: Transfer learning from other ClearML experiments with the same architecture.
- [ ] **Process**: Easy model selection and training with TIMM.
- [ ] **Process**: Hyperparameter optimization using Optuna for grid search.
- [ ] **Output**: Storage of raw artifacts and ONNX models in blob storage.
- [ ] **Output**: Basic graphs for monitoring the deep learning process.
- [ ] **Data Augmentation**: Implement common data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
- [ ] **Model Evaluation**: Include detailed evaluation metrics and visualization tools.
- [ ] **Deployment**: Provide scripts or guidelines for deploying the trained model.
- [ ] **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrate with logging and monitoring tools like TensorBoard or ClearML's dashboard.
- [ ] **Custom Callbacks**: Allow users to add custom callbacks for more control over the training process.
- [ ] **Multi-GPU/TPU Support**: Ensure the template supports distributed training on multiple GPUs or TPUs.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for each module and feature.
